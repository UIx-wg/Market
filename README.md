# Crypto Pool & Market Dashboard

A modern, full-stack cryptocurrency market and mining pool dashboard featuring:

- **Aero UI**: Sleek, glassy white and pink theme with animated background.
- **Crypto Market Table**: Real-time (or demo) display of 30+ cryptocurrencies.
- **Mining Pool Backend**: Simulated mining block/hash regeneration, auto-updating.
- **Explorer**: Search by block number or hash.
- **API & Docs**: Example endpoints for real integration.
- **Responsive & Interactive**: Desktop and mobile friendly, live search, smooth UI.

## Features

### 1. Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Navigation**: Market, Pool, API, Explorer menus.
- **Crypto Market Table**: 5 columns, 30+ cryptocurrencies, live fuzzy search.
- **Mining Pool Cards**: Displays current block, hash, mining status with real-time auto regeneration and manual controls.
- **Explorer**: Input field to search/display current block or hash.
- **API Docs**: Example GET/POST endpoints.
- **Animated Aero Background**: Pink circles float and move (css/js).
- **Responsive**: Adapts to all device sizes.

### 2. Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/market`: Returns cryptocurrency market data (mock, easily swappable for real API).
  - `/api/pool/status`: Returns current block, hash, mining status.
  - `/api/pool/regenerate`: POST endpoint to regenerate block/hash.
  - `/api/explorer/search`: Search current block/hash.
- **Mining Pool Simulation**: In-memory, auto-regenerates block/hash at random intervals (simulates mining in real-time).
- **Static Serving**: Serves frontend from `public/`.
- **SPA Support**: All routes fallback to `index.html`.

## How It Was Created

### Design Philosophy
- **Modern, clean, and visually appealing** by leveraging Aero UI patterns (glassmorphism, soft shadows, pink/white gradients).
- **Separation of concerns**: All UI/UX in the frontend, all data/state in the backend.
- **No external JS frameworks**: Pure HTML/CSS/vanilla JS for portability.
- **Backend ready for real-world integration**: Easily connect APIs like CoinGecko, mining pool daemons, etc.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Frontend UI/UX**  
   - Designed with HTML5 semantic tags and CSS custom properties for Aero/pink theme.
   - Navigation and app sections built with cards and responsive grid/flex layouts.
   - Animated Aero background created using JS to move semi-transparent pink circles.
   - Table and cards are dynamic, updated via JS using data from the backend.

2. **Crypto Market Table**  
   - Demo data for 30+ tokens; frontend fetches from `/api/market` endpoint.
   - Search filters tokens in real time.
   - Neat 5-column layout with price, change, market cap, etc.

3. **Mining Pool Simulation**  
   - Pool status cards fetch data from `/api/pool/status`.
   - Block and hash auto-regenerate in the backend (in-memory), mimicking mining.
   - Manual regeneration via POST `/api/pool/regenerate` and UI buttons.
   - Status updates every few seconds.

4. **Explorer & API Documentation**  
   - Explorer input queries `/api/explorer/search` for block/hash in current state.
   - API docs section outlines available endpoints.

5. **Backend (Node.js/Express)**  
   - Serves static frontend files from `/public`.
   - Handles all API endpoints with in-memory state (easy to swap for real mining/market APIs).
   - SPA fallback for direct URL navigation.

6. **Integration**  
   - All dynamic features (market, mining pool, explorer) are API-driven.
   - JS files (`market.js`, `pool.js`) fetch and update UI from backend endpoints.

## To Run This Project

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser** at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Customization & Real API Integration

- **Real Market Data**:  
  Replace the demo array in `/api/market` with a fetch from CoinGecko, Binance, etc.
- **Mining Pool Integration**:  
  Replace in-memory mining logic in `server.js` with your mining pool's API or daemon.
- **Theme**:  
  Easily adjust the Aero colors and gradients in `style.css`.

## Credits

- **Design/UI**: Inspired by Aero glassmorphism and pink gradient trends.
- **Frontend/Backend**: All code is original, vanilla, and dependency-free (except Express backend).
- **For Real-World Use**: Integrate with real mining pools and crypto APIs as needed!
